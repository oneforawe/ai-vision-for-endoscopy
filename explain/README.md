Here you can find material that explains the project and investigates the input and output (mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks).

The best starting point is the presentations folder.  The rest of the material is essentially scratch notes.

Notes:
* EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis
* demonstrations illustrate how the code works
* presentations include slide shows (aka "demos")
