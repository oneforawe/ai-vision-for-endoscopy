This folder contains environment files and some notes, in `recommended_machine.md` and `Note_git_lfs.md`.

The environment files can be used to create environments in which to run the project's code.  The files here are probably excessive, so the minimal requirements are placed in the root folder with the `environment.yml` file there, which is used to create a conda environment called `analyzer_env`.  The `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` files in the root folder can be used to create a python package for this project.  Here in this folder, the `environment.yml` YAML file was generated from `conda env export > environment.yml` and updated with `conda env update -f environment.yml`.  The `spec-file.txt` text file was generated from `conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt`.  And the `requirements.txt` file was generated from `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
